Theme:
	I used the theme as pencil skecthing portafollio web site. Within the portfolio, 
you will encounter a diverse collection of pencil sketches that depict various subjects, 
ranging from portraits and figures to landscapes, still life, and beyond. Through this 
exploration, I strive to convey the timeless allure of pencil artistry, where the absence 
of color enables a focus on form, texture, and the depth of human emotions. By focusing on 
the power of pencil sketches, I aim to highlight the notion that simplicity can often 
convey profound beauty. Pencil sketches possess a raw and intimate quality, capturing the 
soul of a subject while leaving room for the viewer's interpretation and imagination to 
flourish.
